Welcome to cmis_storage's documentation!
=================================================================

**cmis_storage** is a storage engine for Django to integrate CMIS-compatible services, like Alfresco.
It's currently compatible with Django 1.7+ and Python 2.7, and uses Apache cmislib. Python 3.x is not
currently supported because cmislib does not support it yet.
